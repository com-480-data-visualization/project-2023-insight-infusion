              Additives are substances that are added to food products during processing to maintain or improve certain properties such 
              as appearance, freshness, taste or texture. <br><br>

              The development of food consumption habits has required a transformation of the food industry which must produce in greater 
              quantities. Thus, additives are sometimes necessary to ensure that processed foods remain safe and wholesome throughout their journey from 
              factories through transportation to warehouses and stores to consumers. <br><br>

              Nevertheless, many products contain non-essential additives that do not serve a necessary need but are present only to embellish 
              the product, to make it more attractive either its taste or its appearance (artificial sweeteners, food colorings, and flavor 
              enhancers). Other products contain preservatives to increase the shelf life of the product. <br><br>

              <p>
                Many additives present health risks and it is important to be aware of the products we consume. 
                Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States 
                or the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluate and regulate the use of additives and put in place restrictions 
                on quantities. <br><br>

                Nevertheless, some of these substances still present risks and many scientific studies show a correlation between high 
                consumption of certain additives and adverse health effects such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer.

                For our project, we used data from the company Yuka, which reviewed numerous scientific studies on the effects of 
                additive consumption in order to assign a score to each of them according to their dangerousness : <br><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>0 : No risk</li>
                  <li>1 : Limited risk</li>
                  <li>2 : Moderate risk</li>
                  <li>3 : Hazardous</li>

          <p>
            The presence and the danger of additives depend strongly on the categories of products. 
            Indeed, we find much more additives in cold cuts, sweetened drinks and ready-made meals 
            than in vegetables, pasta and vegetable milks for example. <br><br>

            The following graph shows these two variables, the presence (radius) and the dangerousness 
            (color) by product category. We can clearly observe that the delicatessen and the sodas 
            represent the most dangerous products.

              <h2>NOVA Index</h2>
              <p>
                The NOVA index is used to indicate how processed a product is. Product processing is a broad term that can 
                mean mixing different products to create a new one as well as several processing steps such as cooking, 
                freezing, drying, fermenting and, of course, adding additives. The NOVA index is defined as follows: <br><br>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>1 : Unprocessed or minimally processed foods</li>
                  <li>2 : Processed culinary ingredients</li>
                  <li>3 : Processed foods</li>
                  <li>4 : Ultra-processed food and drink products</li>
                </ul> <br>
              <p>
                As shown in the graph opposite, ultra-processed products contain significantly more additives than other 
                products and also a higher proportion of hazardous additives. Here are some key facts about the impact 
                of product processing:

            The results of the product category analysis on the high presence of additives in meat products 
            led us to analyze the impact of different diets. <br><br>

            The vegetarian diet consists in avoiding all animal flesh (meat, fish, seafood, poultry, etc.).  
            The vegan diet is an addition to vegetarianism by abstaining from all animal products (milk, eggs, etc.). <br><br>

            As shown in the two graphs on the left, a vegetarian or vegan diet can significantly reduce the number
